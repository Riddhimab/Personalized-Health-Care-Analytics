### Load auxiliary R file
source("DataAnalyticsFunctions.R")
######################################################
### Load infant weight data
load("natalityNew.Rda")
### This creates a data frame called "d" 
### This data set has 198377 observations
### 19 variables but we need to clean up a little
### Lets see a summary of the data
summary(d)
######################################################
### The following code will clean up the data for you
###  
###
### tri.none is all zeros so we will remove it. 
### birmon is all 6 so we will remove it.
### Also, there are redundancies (and identifier number). 
### We will remove the following varaibles: "id","birmon","tri.none","novisit"
### to do that lets create a vector with those names
drops <- c("id","birmon","tri.none","novisit")
### names(d) has all the column names. We want to REMOVE the names in drops
### names(d) %in% drops tells you which entry of names(d) is in drops
names(d) %in% drops
### this is a value of true/false for each column
### since we want "not in" we reverse that with the command "!"
!( names(d) %in% drops )
### we can use the logical vector above to select the columns
### the following command creates a dataframe (called DATA) 
### which has all the columns from d not in drops
DATA <- d[,!(names(d) %in% drops)]
summary(DATA)

```


```{r}
### Question 1: Finding a significant relationship between 2 variables.

### When plotting different visualizations of various variables, the visualizations with barplot made much more sense
### We found a meaningful relationship between mom age and smoking and plotted barplot to visually see those relationships

### computing total number of smokers per age
age_smoke <- aggregate(smoke ~ mom.age, data = DATA, sum)

### Making barplot for total number of smokers for each age
barplot(age_smoke[,2], names.arg = age_smoke[,1], main = "Mom Age vs Smoke", xlab = "Mom age", ylab = "Number of smokers")

### We can also check whether, on average, moms who smoke have babies that have lower weight than those who don't smoke
mean_smoke <- aggregate(weight ~ smoke, data = DATA, mean)

### barplot of mean weight of babies per smoke group
barplot(mean_smoke[,2], names.arg = mean_smoke[,1], ylim = c(0,4), xlab = "Smoke", ylab = "Average Weight")

### One implication may be that smoking does indeed impact negatively on baby weight

```


```{r}
# Question 2 : Testing the independence of variables 
### Organizational help for Question 2 
### 
### This creates a matrix with only the 10 binary variables 
MatrixComp <- as.matrix( cbind( DATA$boy, DATA$tri1, DATA$tri2, DATA$tri3, DATA$black, DATA$married, DATA$ed.hs, DATA$ed.smcol, DATA$ed.col, DATA$smoke ))  
### Here is the associated LAbels (for convenience)
LabelsTmp <- c( "boy", "tri1", "tri2", "tri3", "black", "married", "ed.hs", "ed.smcol", "ed.col","smoke")
### Number of columns (should be 10)
NumCol <- ncol(MatrixComp)
### Next we compute the p-values for each pair
pvals <- rep(0, NumCol*(NumCol-1)/2) 
### Also will collect the pair label
ListLabels <- rep("", NumCol*(NumCol-1)/2) 
k <- 0
for (i in 1:(NumCol-1) ){
  for ( j in (i+1):NumCol ){
    k <- k+1
    ### Creates the entries of the contingency table
    m00 <- sum( (MatrixComp[,i] == 0) & (MatrixComp[,j] == 0) ) 
    m01 <- sum( (MatrixComp[,i] == 0) & (MatrixComp[,j] == 1) ) 
    m10 <- sum( (MatrixComp[,i] == 1) & (MatrixComp[,j] == 0) ) 
    m11 <- sum( (MatrixComp[,i] == 1) & (MatrixComp[,j] == 1) ) 
    ### Construct the contingency table
    ContingencyMatrix <- as.table(rbind(c(m00, m01), c(m10, m11)))
    ### Perform the Pearson chi squares test for independent of factors
    # store the p-value of the test 
    pvals[k] <- chisq.test(ContingencyMatrix)$p.value  
    # create the Label
    ListLabels[k] <- paste(LabelsTmp[i],LabelsTmp[j], sep=" and ")  
  }  
}
###############################################################
### Now you have:
### a list of p-values; and
### a list of labels to help you identify which are the variables 
###
### pvals: is a vector with 45 p-values each associated with an independency test
### ListLabels: is a vector with the labels of the 2 variables used on each the independence test


## We can list out the variables that are dependent as they do not meet the 0.05 traditional threshold
print("Testing independance")
ListLabels[pvals > 0.05]
##Using Bonferroni correction we must do, alpha_new = 0.05/45 = 0.001111111
print("After applying Bonferroni correction")
ListLabels[pvals > 0.05/45]

### Question 3
library(caTools)

#Splitting the data into training and testing
split = sample.split(d$weight, SplitRatio = 0.8)
training_set <- subset(DATA, split == TRUE)
test_set <- subset(DATA, split == FALSE)

```

```{r}

### Question 3

library("corrplot")

### Creating a correlation matrix
corrplot(cor(DATA))

#Trying out different models based on what we thought would be a good predictor for weight
model1<-lm(training_set$weight~training_set$m.wtgain)
summary(model1)

model2<-lm(training_set$weight~training_set$mom.age)
summary(model2)

model3<-lm(training_set$weight~training_set$mom.age2)
summary(model3)

model4<-lm(training_set$weight~training_set$mom.age+ training_set$m.wtgain)
summary(model4)

model5<-lm(training_set$weight~training_set$mom.age2+ training_set$m.wtgain + training_set$cigsper )
summary(model5)

model6<-lm(training_set$weight~training_set$mom.age2+ training_set$m.wtgain + training_set$cigsper+training_set$black+training_set$married)
summary(model6)

# The final model that we ended up with, because it showed better results (i.e. lower Residual Standard Error)
model7 <- lm(weight~black+married+boy+tri1+tri2+tri3+ed.hs+ed.smcol+ed.col+mom.age+smoke+cigsper+m.wtgain+mom.age2, DATA)
summary(model7)
```
```{r}
#Using the model to make predictions of infant birth weight on the testing set

#Data frame for forecasting. Dropping the column that we are trying to forecast
test_set_new <- subset(test_set,select=-weight)

# making the prediction
forecast <- predict(model7,newdata = test_set_new, interval = "prediction")

# Joining data frame of forecast with actual values
forecasted_values <- data.frame(forecast, "Actual" = test_set$weight)

#Computing the root mean squared error of the testing set
RMSE <-sqrt(mean((forecasted_values$fit - forecasted_values$Actual)^2))

anova(model7)
```




```{r}

### Question 4
### Making a model with 14 variables mentioned in exhibit 1

model_x <- lm(DATA$weight ~ ., data = DATA)

summary(model_x)
which(summary(model_x)$coef[,4] < 0.05)
which(summary(model_x)$coef[,4] < 0.05/14)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
