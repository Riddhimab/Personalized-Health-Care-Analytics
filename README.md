# Personalized-Health-Care-Analytics

Background  

The Health Care industry annual revenue exceeds a trillion dollars with over seven hundred thousand 
health  care  companies  in  the  US.  The  size  and  scope  of  this  massive  industry  generate  a  variety  of  
opportunities  and  challenges.  Part  of  these  challenges  arises  from  the  unavoidable  role  Government  
needs to play when regulating public health policies. For example, how much to tax smoking to offset 
associated health care costs or who to target ad campaigns to reduce smoking more effectively. Such 
decisions are difficult and controversial and as such they require convincing evidence to be 
implemented. Other challenges arise from logistic issues with industry specific constraints. For example, 
hospital  staffing  has  proven  difficult  because  of  the  very  nature  of  the  service.  One  needs  to  balance  
continuous shifts and mandatory rest periods required by syndicate laws and safety practices. 
Fundamentally, the demand for health care has a high uncertainty due to emergencies and unforeseen 
events. Finally, even though more accurate tests and increasingly effective drugs are being developed, 
their costs have grown to unsustainable levels for many primary care facilities especially in rural areas. 
Therefore, in many areas, technology is no longer the bottleneck, rather finding cost effective solutions 
which requires compromises is the issue.  
 
It is clear that health care analytics can play a significant role in these opportunities. Given the pressure 
to  diminish  health  care  costs  and  the  size  of  the  assets  involved  (from  machines  to  personnel),  even 
small gains in efficiency can translate into important contributions to the balance sheet.  
 
Data Analytics to Achieve Cost Effective Screening: Birthweight Pilot Study 


The use of health care analytics can provide more accurate and personalized assessments when patient 
specific information is available. However, analytics can be used as a cost effective screening option only 
if the required patient information is available at a low cost. To convince stakeholders typically a pilot 
study is important. Moreover, success in one application will typically lead to additional resources in the 
future. 
 
We will consider screening for risk of complications with newborns at low cost (which is of interest in 
rural  areas).  In  particular,  we  will  exploit  the  fact  that  many  complications  are  associated  with  low 
birthweight. Thus cost effective screening procedures are needed for that. The first step in the pilot study 
is  to  predict  birth  weights  based  on  available  information.  Detailed  “natality  data”  are  recorded  for  
nearly every live birth in the United States. Information on maternal characteristics (age, education, race, 
etc), prenatal care (number of prenatal visits, smoking status, etc) and birth outcomes (birthweight) is 
collected by each state (with federal guidelines on specific data-item requirements). Unfortunately, at 
this early stage of the pilot study, due to confidentiality restrictions, we do not have  full access to the 
medical and demographic information of patients. Therefore, results obtained should be seen essentially 
as a “lower bound” on the predictive performance of this approach.  
 
 
 
“Personalized” Staffing Decisions in Health Care Facilities  
Historically,  staffing  decisions  have  been  made  to  manage  observed  typical  demand.  This  usually  
requires substantial adjustments and the placing of several medical and staff members on call. The use 
of data to improve staffing decisions is not new. For example, for many decades aggregate level of daily 
“patients’ demand” has been recorded and staffing decisions typically adjust for the day of the week, 
hour of the day, and holidays. Nonetheless, every hospital department faces different types of demands. 
Indeed, cardiologists and dermatologists face substantially different uncertainties.  
 
A complementary approach is to use individual specific information of the current patients. Indeed, in 
the vast majority of days, most duties are due to current patients whose detailed medical records are 
known  and,  to  some  extent,  ready  to  be  used.  In  principle,  this  can  be  used  to  forecast  short  and  
medium-term  needs  more  accurately  by  conditioning  on  all  the  information  currently  available.  This  
allows also for real-time updates on schedules and “on call” duties in a much more adaptive way. 
 
 
Baseline and Deployment  
In any data analytics application, we will be challenged on two counts that might not seem a part of the 
data  analytics  per  se.  Nonetheless,  they  are  fundamental  aspects  of  the  creation  of  successful  data  
analytic tools. The first one is the need to quantify the impact of the proposed methods achieve. That is, 
to  establish  a  proper  baseline  for  comparison.  The  second  is  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  
approach.  Even  the  most  promising  data  analytic  tool  can  hit  a  wall  if  its  deployment  boils  down  to  
substantially changing the way an organization works.
